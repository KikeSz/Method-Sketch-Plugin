## How to control all the spacing and sizes?

For some years now, I've been using a work methodology based on 8px. The goal is to improve my work-flow and shushing thoughts like "try putting this a little to the right. Wait, no! Better to the left! Let’s see it from far…" The theory is quite simple: the idea is that all the elements in your design are a multiple of 8 in terms of width and height, just as their spacing.

That's why I've created this plugin to make it easier to apply working methodologies with respect to multiple 6, 8, 10...etc.

## Functionalities

Okay, so you've probably even read all this stuff about 8 spacing but... what, sizes too? If you're a designer with a brush of OCD like me... please, don't keep on reading. When you start designing with multiple spacings of 8 —as proposed by Material Design and other manuals— you realize that, if the container of the layer you're positioning doesn't have a multiple of 8 size it’ll. JUST. NOT. FIT! However, if everything is a multiple of 8... it will always fit; be it 144, 1600... you name it.

### Settings ⚙️

I am an advocate of working with multiples of 8 but, if someone has another preference, you will be able to change it, The value will remain saved until you decide to change it.

### Round 🧮

Goodbye, calculator! Ctrl+8 and the object will be shaped to 8 in height and width. The idea is that if all object sizes are multiples of 8, all spaced objects will be multiples of 8. This was a problem for large sizes, with "Round" it is simpler.
     
```
ctrl 8
```

### Resize 📐

"Just a bit more" "Just a Little less" but 8 by 8 version. When the layer is already multiple of 8, but we want to enlarge it or make it smaller, "Resize" helps you not to go arrow to arrow.

``` 
ctrl cmd ↑ , ctrl cmd ↓ , ctrl cmd → , ctrl cmd ←
```

### Move 📏

Move from 8 to 8, so damn easy! Sometimes moving our layers around the canvas is a little slow. This is in case you want to go a little faster but Sketch's Nudgeds don't suit you...

``` 
shift ctrl ↑ , shift ctrl ↓ , shift ctrl → , shift ctrl ←
```

### Future

It is always a work in progress but, with some or other technical difficulty (I'm not an emoji programmer, you know) the idea is that this methodology flows softly with smart-guides. If someone wants to try it on GitHub, the source code is completely free and modifiable
